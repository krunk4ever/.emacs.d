;; On Mac OS X, GUI programs do not get a sensible PATH variable (i.e.
;; from /usr/libexec/path_helper). You can mitigate this by setting
;; the PATH variable in the binary plist file at this path:
;;
;;   ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist
;;
;; Easiest way is using defaults:
;;
;;   defaults write $HOME/.MacOSX/environment PATH "$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/X11/bin"
;;
;; You will have to log out and back in for this to take effect.
